/*
We call a positive integer special if all of its digits are distinct.

Given a positive integer n, return the number of special integers that belong to the interval [1, n].


Input: n = 20
Output: 19
Explanation: All the integers from 1 to 20, except 11, are special. Thus, there are 19 special integers.
